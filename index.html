				<h2>Wish you were here</h2>
					<p>	So, so you think you can tell<br>
						Heaven from Hell,<br>
						Blue skies from pain.<br>
						Can you tell a green field<br>
						From a cold steel rail?<br>
						A smile from a veil?<br>
						Do you think you can tell?<br><br>
					</p>
					<p>	Did they get you to trade<br>
						Your heroes for ghosts?<br>
						Hot ashes for trees?<br>
						Hot air for a cool breeze?<br>
						Cold comfort for change?<br>
						Did you exchange<br>
						A walk on part in the war,<br>
						For a lead role in a cage?<br><br>
					</p>
					<p> How I wish, how I wish you were here.<br>
						We're just two lost souls<br>
						Swimming in a fish bowl,<br>
						Year after year,<br>
						Running over the same old ground.<br>
						What have we found<br>
						The same old fears.<br>
						Wish you were here.<br>
					</p>
